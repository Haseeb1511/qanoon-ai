# Project Changes to backend while making frontend
## Backend (`backend/app.py`)
### added `GET /all_threads`
- Purpose: To allow the frontend sidebar to display a list of all chat histories (persistence).
- Implementation: Fetches `thread_id`, `doc_id`, and `messages` from the Supabase `threads` table. It returns a simplified list containing the `thread_id`, `doc_id`, and a preview text derived from the first message.
